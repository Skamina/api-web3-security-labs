## Overview

api-web3-security-labs provides practical, scenario-based labs covering various security topics relevant to Web3 APIs, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. Each lab includes vulnerable code samples, attack scenarios, and mitigation strategies.

## Labs

Some example labs (expand as needed):

- **Lab 1:** Improper Authentication in Web3 APIs
- **Lab 2:** Insecure Smart Contract Interactions
- **Lab 3:** Signature Replay Attacks
- **Lab 4:** Front-running and Transaction Manipulation
- **Lab 5:** Data Leakage via Public Endpoints

Each lab features:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Step-by-step exploitation guide
- Remediation techniques
